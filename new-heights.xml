      <itunes:summary>92%ers welcome back to another episode of New Heights brought to you by our friends at Suave Men. Check out their no-nonsense self-care today! 

On today’s episode, we’re joined by Cleveland Browns legend and NFL Hall of Famer, Joe Thomas! 

Before we get to Joe, Jason and Travis catch up by breaking down the greatest Easter tweet of all time and announcing the movies we need you to vote on for the next edition of the New Heights Film Club. 

Joe Thomas joins us to share his hysterical reason he skipped the NFL Draft, the wild story about meeting his starting QB for the first time while in the huddle, and how he really feels about all those Browns losing records. 

We also get into how he mentored a young Myles Garrett, we answer a not-dumb question about finger liquid, and why he might be headed to a “Beef Off” with Jason. 

We will be back next week with reactions to the NFL draft and another incredible guest. 

To learn more about Joe’s Hall-of-Fame beef, visit: http://sixspringsfarms.com/

      <itunes:summary>92%ers welcome back to another episode of New Heights brought to you by our friends at Draft Kings! 

On today’s episode, we are joined by Cleveland Cavalier Donovan Mitchell! 

Donovan and the guys discuss everything from the Cavs being the #1 seed in the East, the Luka trade, Ja Morant’s celebrations, and more of our favorite NBA storylines headed into the playoffs. 

We also learn the backstory behind his time at Louisville with Lamar Jackson, his record-setting 71-point game against the Bulls, and what it was like to attend “The Decision” as a kid. 

We also Blind Rank the greatest NBA throwback jersey of all time, debate how many holes are in a basketball hoop, figure out how much he’d score in the 70s, Donovan’s all-time starting five, and so much more.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers welcome back to another episode of New Heights! Once again brought to you by the HBO Original series The Last of Us premiering Sunday at 9 PM on Max! 

Today we are joined by Eagles legend Brandon Graham! 

Brandon and the guys get into everything from his emotional retirement announcement, his relationship with Philadelphia fans, the one play he would ban in the NFL, and his new children’s book. 

We also get into his relationship with Andy Reid, his favorite Jason Kelce rookie stories, how much research goes into his trash-talking, if he can remember all the QBs he’s sacked, and how often he’s asked about his iconic Super Bowl sack of Tom Brady. 

After the Brandon Graham convo, Jason and Travis offer the best golf advice that two football players can offer and we dive into a chain gang conspiracy theory. 

Check out BG’s ABCs on Amazon: https://a.co/d/5Qk650y

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by Nike! When the world says you can’t win, Nike says, “So Win” 

On today’s episode, Jason and Travis weigh in on the latest news from NFL Free Agency including revealing how much players snitch on their old teams, why the Cowboys are fighting online, and if the Bengals made the right call by signing Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins to record-breaking contracts. 

We also have an incredible conversation with Ben Stiller. We get into everything from the guy's love of “Heavyweights”, what really happens at NFL training camps, who’s idea it was for Tom Cruise to dance in “Tropic Thunder”, if Ben would give up an Academy Award for a Knicks Title, and all of Jason and Travis’ biggest questions about “Severance.” 

Finally, we have potentially the least helpful March Madness breakdown of all time. If your criteria for picking teams involve fighting ability, if they shoot underhand free throws, higher GPAs, or any other broad generalizations, this bracket preview is for you!

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by Buffalo Wild Wings Go!

Today, we are coming to you in person from the home of Super Bowl LIX, New Orleans Louisiana! 

We’ve got an incredible episode, the Manning brothers join us to talk all things Super Bowl LIX, their relationships with Mahomes and Hurts, the backstory behind Peyton’s viral moment with Jeff Saturday, if either of them would’ve liked playing with Travis, and who would’ve won the hypothetical, “Manning Bowl.” 

We also sample some authentic New Orleans food, Jason learns how to eat a crawfish, Travis gives his final thoughts before the game, we figure out if Travis is a time traveller or not, and so much more! 

New Heights will be back next Wednesday to recap Super Bowl LIX and get into what we have planned for the offseason.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers this is for you! We’ve got King James himself stopping by on this episode of New Heights presented by Hershey’s. Shop Reese's Chocolate Lava Big Cup now at a store near you. 

LeBron sits down with Jason and Travis to talk all things Wild Card Weekend, how close he came to playing in the NFL, some of his favorite times hooping in Cleveland, the Championship that means the most to him, and his real thoughts on playing with Bronny. 

We also settle the debate on which league owns Christmas, get the backstory on a legendary pick-up game against Michael Jordan, and find out how much longer “this fuckery” can go on. 

Finally, as promised, we look ahead to the divisional round of the playoffs and blindly rank our favorite Will Ferrell movies.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with another incredible episode brought to you by American Express.

Today we are joined by Buddy the Elf, Ricky Bobby, Ron Burgundy, Chaz Michael-Michaels, Frank the Tank himself…Will Ferrell!

Will and the guys talk about everything from why Buddy the Elf was down bad at the LA Kings game, the time he kicked Shaq out of a Lakers game, his short-lived stint as a walk-on kicker at USC, and the back story behind his legendary “Cat Audition” for SNL.

We also find out his favorite SNL character of all time, his hysterical take on Travis’ goal post dunk, which of his movie characters would make the best NFL QB, and Ron Burgundy gives some relationship advice to a 92% in need.

We will return next week with reactions to Wild Card Weekend and maybe some more surprises!

We also find out just how close she came to playing for Notre Dame, who can name the most Iowa NFL players, pitch ideas to help the NBA ratings, her GOAT basketball shoe, and so much more.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>17</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>92%ers, we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Google TV—no more endless browsing. Google TV makes it easy to find what to watch. 

In this episode, the guys react to the end of the Eras Tour, Travis gets candid about his nomination for Walter Payton Man of the Year, we break down the Chiefs division-clinching doink against the Chargers, and Jason weighs in on the Eagles' frustrations after the Panthers game. 

We also react to Dan Campbell’s gamble against the Packers, the potential game of the year between the Bills and Rams, and Juan Soto’s $765 million contract. There are also some great voicemails asking for worst first dates advice and an explanation of “the annexation of Puerto Rico.”

      <itunes:summary>92%ers, we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Google TV. No more endless browsing. Google TV makes it easy to find what to watch. 

In this episode, we are joined by an incredible guest, Ernie McCracken himself, Bill Murray. 

Before we sit down with Bill, we answer a celebrity voicemail demanding we review a specific movie for Christmas, Travis breaks down the controversial ending of the Chiefs Black Friday game against the Raiders, and Jason shares his thoughts on the Eagles continuing their hot streak against Lamar Jackson and the Ravens. 

Finally, we sit down with Bill Murray and talk about everything from his favorite golf partners, what it was like growing up in the Murray household, how a “cat lady” got him started in improv, the early days of SNL, his surprise pick for best host of all time, the worst thing he’s ever said on camera, and why he’s still making prank calls about “Road House.”

      <itunes:summary>92%ers, we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV. Right now you can get NFL Sunday Ticket for just 89 dollars. 

Offer ends December 2, Terms and embargoes apply.

In this episode, we learn about some brand-new additions to the Kelce universe, a late-night show, and Jason and Kylie's baby #4. 

Travis also breaks down another Chief’s close call in Carolina, including the unsung hero of Patrick Mahomes’ fourth-quarter scramble, the emergence of Noah Gray, and what advice Andy Reid gave them about playing on Black Friday. 

We also get to the rest of a chaotic Week 12 in the NFL that featured Saquon and the Eagles running all over the Rams, the insane ending of Cowboys/Commanders, Jameis Winston “Mic’d Up” in the snow, Baker doing his best Tommy Cutlets impression, and more. 

Finally, we have what you’ve all been waiting for, our review of the 1989 classic Road House. We discuss everything from the insane bar fights, the sexiness of 80s Swayze, the most insane one-liner we’ve ever heard, and why this movie might need to be the new “Jumanji” in your household.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers, we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV. Right now you can get NFL Sunday Ticket for just 89 dollars. 

Offer ends December 2, Terms and embargoes apply.

In this episode, Jason and Travis discuss Mama Kelce’s small-screen debut, get Jason’s thoughts on his live performance and the Linc, and a tubular meat world record devolves into…well you’ll see. Sorry. 

We also get Travis thoughts on the Chief's first loss of the season and how they plan to bounce back next week. Jason also tells us if Coach Sirianni has earned some love from the Philly fans and if Saquon Barkley should be in the MVP discussion. 

Next, we look at the rest of Week 11 in the NFL including the Steelers proving that field goals still matter, which teams might be making some coaching changes soon, and the guys share their honest thoughts on the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight. 

Finally, we dip into the Heights Hotline for some calls about the official 92% greeting, when to put up the Christmas tree, and why Jason doesn’t do the dishes.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers, we are back with another episode of New Heights with Dodgers World Series MVP Freddie Freeman!

We also get his thoughts on LeBron’s misspelled shout-out, the backup career we never could’ve guessed, how the Dodgers dealt with the media circus surrounding Shohei Ohtani, if he thinks Anthony Rizzo should’ve pitched in the World Series, why Bad Bunny is his choice for walk-up music, and so much more!

      <itunes:summary>92%ers, we are back with another episode of New Heights! 

In this episode, we are joined by an incredible guest MLB legend CC Sabathia! 

Before we get to CC, we address Jason being called out to kick for a good cause, provide an update on the ‘Heights Hotline,’ and react to the famous reactions we got from our Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants review. 

We’ve also got a full recap of Jason getting Outta the House at the Eras tour in Miami, Travis breaking down the Chiefs' Super Bowl rematch against the Niners, and a look at some of the best internet reactions to Pat Mahomes ‘dad bod’ TD that broke the internet. 

We also get into everything else from Week 7 in the NFL including Jason’s thoughts on Saquon going off against the Giants, reactions to a huge NFC North showdown, and try and explain why Jets fans might be losing their minds. 

Finally, we sit down for an incredible conversation with CC Sabathia. The guys get into everything from why this might be the best World Series of all time, if NFL players could make it in the majors, the hitters he’s glad to never face again, and so much more!

      <itunes:summary>92%ers, we are back with another episode of New Heights and in this episode we are joined by an incredible guest, Pat McAfee! 

Before we get to Pat we’ve got an update on Travis’ debut as a game show host and when you can expect our review of Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants. 

We’ve also got a full recap of the double tailgates Jason attended over the weekend, we try to figure out what was on Travis’ shirt, and what he thought of Game 1 of the ALCS. 

We also get into everything else from Week 6 in the NFL, including Jason’s full thoughts on everything that happened in the Eagles/Browns game, Davante Adams becoming a Jet, and the Cowboys getting blown out again at home. 

Finally, we sit down for an electric conversation with Pat McAfee. The guys get into everything from his thoughts on Jason’s kicker slander, how he got started in the media after playing, his way too early Super Bowl pick, and so much more.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers, we are back with another episode of New Heights! 

In this episode, we are coming to you live (pre-recorded) from Kansas City! We’ve got a shout out to Mama Kelce for making the cover of Glamour, the New Heights Film Club poll results, and Jason continues to try and guess what is going to happen on Grotesquerie. 

Jason recaps his weekend Outta the House in Kansas City at the Kelce Car Jam, signing someone’s leg on Monday Night Countdown, and his time tailgating with the Kingdom before Monday Night Football. 

Travis also settles the debate on his primetime lateral, explains why the Chiefs offense clicked so well against The Saints, and shouts out an incredibly athletic “thick pick”

We also get into everything else from Week 5 in the NFL, including NFL offenses being very much alive, the Giants pulling off something not a lot of people thought was legal, some incredible trench trash talk, locker room “meat watchers,” and the breaking news of the Jets sudden head coaching vacancy.

Rushmore.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, Travis breaks down how he’s feeling going into season 12 in the NFL, his thoughts on some of his new teammates, and a preview of the Week 1 match-up against Lamar Jackson and the Ravens.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we find out what Jason was up to at Eagles camp, if he’s any closer to joining the coaching staff, and his thoughts on how Jalen Hurts will develop without him at center.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we let you know all the week 1 games that are worth watching, settle the debate on Travis’ eye color, and decide how many wind sprints are too many wind sprints after chugging a pitcher.&nbsp;</p><p>Kelce Car Jam: Year 2 is going to be on Saturday, Oct 5th.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>2</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>92%ers, we are back with another fantastic episode of New Heights brought to you by NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV.

In this episode, we’ve got a lot to get to before the NFL season officially kicks off. We start things with Jason’s update on how he feels about Twitter polls, the results of a questionable llama costume contest, Travis’ new horse, and the guys' reaction to LeBron James’ tight end Mt. Rushmore. 

Next, Travis breaks down how he’s feeling going into season 12 in the NFL, his thoughts on some of his new teammates, and a preview of the Week 1 match-up against Lamar Jackson and the Ravens. 

After that, we find out what Jason was up to at Eagles camp, if he’s any closer to joining the coaching staff, and his thoughts on how Jalen Hurts will develop without him at center. 

Finally, we let you know all the week 1 games that are worth watching, settle the debate on Travis’ eye color, and decide how many wind sprints are too many wind sprints after chugging a pitcher. 

Kelce Car Jam: Year 2 is going to be on Saturday, Oct 5th. Check out the @87running Instagram or visit https://87running.org/ to grab your tickets.

New Heights will be back every Wednesday during the NFL Season so make sure you’re subscribed to our YouTube Channel and follow New Heights on the Wondery App or wherever you get your podcasts.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights sponsored by Crown Royal.

In this episode, we are live from the Passyunk Avenue Bar in London, England!

Before we get into what you all have been waiting for we have to tie up one last Beer Bowl loose end, Travis breaks down his weekend in Nashville golfing with Wayne Gretzky and attending Tight End U, and Jason how his charity golf outing almost got derailed by some Philly hecklers.

Then we gotta talk about it. Jason recaps his first night attending the Eras tour, explains why holding a beer with your teeth isn't a big deal, and what meeting the Royal family was like.

And finally, because this is our London Special, the guys also take a "London Slang Quiz," revive "Player's As" with figures from the Revolutionary War, answer some No Dumb Questions about playing overseas, and sample some authentic British cuisine throughout the episode.

We will be back with more New Heights every Wednesday during the offseason so make sure you're subscribed to our YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don't miss a single episode and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.

In this episode, we've got some updates on how you can attend the biggest party in Kansas City at this year's Kelce Jam 2.0 and where you can watch all of the videos recapping our incredible live show in Cincinnati.

But we've got some important business to get to in this episode including, responding to Ryan Reynolds' and Rob McElhenney's plan to get us to a Wrexham game overseas and Pat Mahomes' claim that he can't keep up with the Kelce boys.

We also have the reveal of Kylie's anniversary sword, our reactions to the roast of Tom Brady, Travis gives us all the details on his time at the races in Kentucky and Miami, and Jason is maybe starting a feud with Secretariat. That horse could outrun the competition but not the asterisk we're adding to the record books.

We finally check in on the NFL now that we're 120 days until kickoff and break down what fans should take away from rookie mini-camps and react to all the guys maybe doing too much in their social media workouts.

Don't forget to check out all the videos from our live show in Cincinnati. The team did some amazing work on all of those, and who knows, maybe you will solve the mystery of Jason's missing ring.

We will be back with more New Heights every Wednesday during the offseason so make sure you're subscribed to our YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don't miss a single episode and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights sponsored by Experian. If you're looking to build your credit without adding debt, check out the Experian Smart Money Debit Card and Digital Checking Account.

In this episode, we've got to start (01:45) with a huge thank you to the over thirty-six thousand of you who entered our first-ever bracket challenge, a full breakdown of Jason becoming the most beloved drive-through customer at McDonald's, and a reaction to Chris Jones discovering that no one has ever said "Kelce" right.

Travis recaps everything that happened ON the field in Buffalo (19:55) including his thoughts on Patrick Mahomes' first road playoff performance, breaking a Gronk playoff record, why he owes Mecole Hardman an apology, and what he said to Josh Allen in the tunnel at halftime.

And you know we gotta talk about it. Jason breaks down everything that happened during his time with Bill's mafia (48:00). We touch on everything from what he drank from the bowling ball, what Kylie thought of his decision to go shirtless, and if this was the perfect way to make a first impression.

We also recap everything else that went down during the divisional round (01:10:31) including the Ravens suffocating win over Houston, the Lions, and the Niners pulling out a win against the Packers.

We will be back Friday with a preview of the Chiefs AFC Championship game in Baltimore and a full breakdown of the second round of our "Best Team Name" bracket challenge.

Travis also gives us the details on the not so Merry Christmas at Arrowhead with the Chiefs coming up short against the Raiders, we get into his sideline helmet toss that got the attention of Andy Reid, why the defense is still keeping them in every game, and what the Chiefs are doing to get the offense rolling again.

We also take a look at the current playoff picture, the refs getting too involved in the Ravens/Niners game, and listen to maybe the loudest field goal doink of all time.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Experian and the all-new Experian Debit Card and Digital checking account!

In this episode, we've got some huge New News (01:40) coming your way about the "Kelce Family Reunion Game," we try and start a petition to send Travis to space (06:25), Jason lets us know why he's staying out of the water (08:40), and we find out who had the worst part-time job in college (17:17).

Moving on, Travis recaps his trip to Germany (36:15), seeing Tyreek on the opposing sideline for the first time (48:00), and why he's not thrilled with how he broke his latest record (55:00).

Jason takes us through an electric Eagles/Cowboys game (01:02:22) and reveals what he was actually screaming during the game (01:08:05) and how he was feeling on the sideline during the wild closing minutes of the game (01:11:00).

We also touch on the Raiders reaction to their Interim Head Coach (01:28:05), CJ Stroud probably locking up rookie of the year (01:32:41), and we can't decide what constitutes taunting anymore (01:34:33).

We will be back next Wednesday to recap Week 10 in the NFL and what the guys get up to during their bye week.

In the meantime, please keep sending in your suggestions for "The Greatest Highlight of All Time" and make sure you've signed up for our official fan club at https://NewHeightShow.com (01:40:45).

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Experian and the all-new Experian Debit Card and Digital checking account!

In this episode, we break the news about another Kelce Christmas album (01:47), Travis trying to take F1 (04:10), and answer your not-dumb questions about the best Halloween Candy (19:07).

Travis also defends National Tight End Day (42:20), breaks down the Chiefs offensive explosion against the Chargers (47:03), and how he feels about the media inventing "Swift Stats." (56:20)

Jason gives us his full reaction to the Eagles finally bringing back the Kelly Greens in their win over the Dolphins (59:55), what it's really like at the bottom of the "Brotherly Shove" pile (01:06:44), and how the Eagles D kept Tyreek Hill in check (01:14:08).

The guys also weigh in on Myles Garrett possibly beating the Colts by himself (01:25:00), all the huge TE stats from National Tight End Day (01:28:00), and if they'll be participating in Olympic Flag Football (01:31:32).

We will be back with our weekend preview video on Friday where we look at both the Chiefs and Eagles huge divisional road games, one of the greatest hits of all time, and what Jason is "dressing as" for Halloween.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Experian and the all-new Experian Debit Card and Digital checking account!

In this episode, we get into all your biggest questions about Jason's nasty locker (02:00), Travis moonlighting as a security guard (05:30), the most confusing penalty in football (22:00), and some cute-ass No Dumb Questions (23:35).

Travis also breaks down Chiefs/Broncos on Thursday night football (30:52) including what he was thinking on that lateral play (37:40), how the Chiefs are improving in the red zone (40:45), and the momentous occasion that was Big Ed Kelce the Swiftie (45:10).

Jason gives us his take on the Eagles first loss of the year against the Jets (50:45) including his feelings on his "start streak," (53:20) how the Eagles offense is going to help out the defense (57:55), and we get another visit from the only Jets fan welcome on the show, Jets Jake. (01:03:30)

The guys also recap getting out of the house with a stop by Saturday Night Live (01:14:05), stopping by the ballpark to see the Phillies take game 1 on the NLCS (01:17:45) and all of the biggest Week 6 NFL Storylines. (01:26:06)

We will be back with our weekend preview video on Friday where we break down the meeting up with the high-powered Dolphins offense, the Chiefs' keeping it in the division against the Chargers, and maybe the greatest lateral all time.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Experian and the all-new Experian Debit Card and Digital checking account!

In this episode, we react to LeBron James wanting to bring his game to New Heights, probably give a too-technical explanation of zone coverage, and reminisce about Travis starting food fights at good ol' Cleveland Heights High.

We also recap Jason's first trip to SoFi Stadium, his reaction to the Swiftie that caught his pre-game warmup, the new way the NFL might ban the "Brotherly Shove," and why he got heated on the sideline.

Also, we get into Travis' trip to Minnesota and our thoughts on the renewed call to ban turf fields, how it felt to come back in the game and immediately find the end zone, and how the Chiefs offense can start helping out the defense.

We also look at other huge stories from Week 5 with the 'Nathaniel Hackett Bowl," Dolphins' historic offense output, Niners' huge win against the Cowboys, and the secrets to traveling internationally for games.

We will be back with our weekend preview video on Thursday where we break down the Eagles trip to New Jersey, the Chiefs' first divisional game against the Broncos and two of the greatest NFL clips of all time.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Experian and the all-new Experian Debit Card and Digital checking account!

In this episode, we get into the Eagles' overtime win against the Commanders, the analytics behind the decision to go for the TD at the end of regulation, and the new ways defenses are attacking "The Brotherly Shove."

We also recap the star-studded affair that was Sunday Night Football between the Chiefs and Jets, Isiah Pacheco's homecoming performance, and get into the penalties that have one specific Jets fan incredibly mad online.

Also, we also recap Donna Kelce's epic weekend, debate if the NFL needs to chill out just a little bit, and try and figure out how Khalil Mack put up 6 sacks against the Raiders.

We will be back with our weekend preview video on Friday exclusively on our YouTube Channel where we'll break down the Eagles trip to Los Angeles, the Chiefs heading to Minnesota for "Kirktober," and look at some of our favorite game tape from last week.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are a little late but we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball.

In this episode, we are joined by maybe the most interesting man in the world, former Army Ranger turned Pro-Bowl left tackle for the Pittsburgh Steelers Alejandro Villanueva.

In our incredible conversation with Alejandro, we get the back story on what happened when he was cut from the Eagles (17:55), why he thinks the NFL Regional Combine is a scam (31:00), how he gained almost 100lbs to play for the Steelers (37:02), what is was really like going up against Jame Harrison in practice every day (49:20), and why Mike Tomlin might be selling himself short (56:26).

We also touch on his time in the US Army and his path to playing football at West Point (58:02), what it was really like to serve three tours in Afghanistan (01:06:45), and how he became an Army Ranger (01:18:00).

As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday &amp;amp; check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

One final programming note. We will be dropping our video from the first ever New Heights Beer Bowl next week, so subscribe and turn your notifications on so you don't miss it.

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball.

In this episode, we are joined by an absolute sports legend. NBA Hall of Famer, Emmy Winner, Olympics Gold medalist, the round mound of rebound…Charles Barkley!

Before we get to Charles, Travis has to address some rumors that we might have started on this show, we recap the Chiefs' visit to the White House and what Travis was going to say at the podium, and we give you guys an update on the Ocean Drive Beer Bowl.

In our great conversation with Sir Charles Barkley, we find out why Charles decided football was NOT for him, what it was like living next door to Mike Tyson, how he knew it was time to retire, what it takes to play in Philly and who he's picking in the NBA finals.

We also get the incredible story about playing against a young Dirk Nowitzki, his welcome to the NBA moment, why Kobe wasn't a fit for Inside the NBA, the truth about the rumor Michael Jordan used golf to beat him in the '93 finals, and the one thing he stole from his time with The Dream Team.

As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday &amp;amp; check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

There is still time to submit your entry to the Ocean Drive Charity Beer Bowl. Send your submission video to @NewHeightShow or email us at NewHeightShow@gmail.com

If you only want to attend the Beer Bowl, be one of the top donors supporting Team 62 and the Eagles Autism Foundation at the link below.

We touch on everything from how he learned he would officially be "Mr. Irrelevant," (23:55) his feelings about trash-talking (28:15), his transition into the Shanahan offense (32:33), learning to throw lefty this offseason (42:30), and which Niner is the biggest deep threat (44:45).

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball.

In this episode, we are joined by an NFL Hall of Famer, Tight End legend, and the man better known as "Unc," Shannon Sharpe.

Shannon talks with the guys about how his mentoring relationship with Travis started (07:20), how the secret to Tight End success might be all in the hips (14:30), and who is on Shannon's TE Mt. Rushmore. (21:00)

We dive into how Shannon was almost cut from the Broncos (35:11), which records he doesn't think anyone will ever touch (31:15), why he'd be putting up "Travis numbers" in the modern NFL (46:15), and why he'd swap places with his brother Sterling if given the chance (01:06:05).

Shannon also gives us his thoughts on the 2000s Raven's defense (01:17:25), if anyone in the NFL would block for Skip Bayless (01:22:55), why LeBron James wouldn't be a great NFL Tight End (01:24:15), and what advice he'd give his rookie self (01:26:35).

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with episode thirty-three of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball.

In this episode, we're breaking down all the news coming out of the Annual Owner's Meeting. Including, Jason's thoughts on the "Tush Push" surviving another season (10:15), why we secretly enjoy kickers getting lit up (14:45), and the number 0 getting added to jerseys (26:10).

In sports, we also have an electric debate on the best digit, yes singular digit (31:25), a chaotic breakdown of the annual coaches' photo (32:54), and Travis' attempt to name every NFL head coach (37:15).

We also speculate about which teams would be the best fit for Lamar Jackson (44:40) and another edition of the "Players As…" segment where you'll find out why Josh Allen is a Natty Light *(50:00).

This episode also includes Jason's incredible conversation with Eagles GM Howie Roseman (59:45). We touch on everything from why he doesn't believe in rebuilds (01:01:40), his relationship with the city of Philadelphia (01:20:15), Jason's scouting report (01:29:17), how he became an NFL GM (01:41:00), and his welcome to the NFL moment with TO (01:46:00).

      <itunes:episode>31</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with episode thirty-one of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball and it has already been a crazy start to free agency.

In this episode, we look at some of the best unsanctioned New Heights Merch (03:55), probably spend too much time sorting NFL players into Hogwarts houses (07:00), and try to figure out who Jerry Jones has been using as a horcrux (13:50).

More importantly, Jason gives us the details on why he decided to run it back for another season (18:05), how he feels about some of the free agency moves the Eagles have made so far (24:28), and Travis welcomes a new teammate to the Chiefs (32:20).

We also touch on some of the other big free agency moves from around the league (32:50), explain why playing "Poop Dollar" is the correct amount of dumb for living in Vegas (36:30), and then finally what the entire NFL world has been waiting for, we react to all the Aaron Rodgers speculation (40:30).

This episode also includes Jason's incredible conversation with Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni (58:50). The guys talk about what he learned in year two (01:02:25), how he rebounded from the infamous opening press conference (01:13:15), the secret to hiring the perfect coordinator (01:25:00), why the QB sneak shouldn't be banned (01:41:50), and how he bribed Jason to come back to the Eagles (01:47:50).

We also need to mention that because of this interview, you t000can get your own "Sirianni Snapback" available here: https://shop.underdogphl.com/underdogphl/shop/product-detail/1001532

      <itunes:summary>92%ers we are back with the thirtieth episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball and we have an exceptional one for you guys.

In this episode, we are talking about all things NFL Combine. Yes, we know this is the start of tampering season, but with Travis hosting SNL we had to delay the recording on this one a little bit.

We break down how getting invited to the combine actually works (07:10), what kind of training goes into preparing for the on-field drills (10:00) and revisit some of the formal interviews that didn't go exactly as planned (17:35).

Next, we tell you what to actually look for when you're watching players do drills (35:50), debate if we should retake the Wonderlic (37:40), and Jason gives us a behind-the-scenes look at what it was like being back at the NFL Combine as a veteran (43:30).

We also have an incredible conversation with former Eagles scout and current NFL Network Draft Analyst, Daniel Jeremiah (45:42). The guys touch on why the Combine still matters (46:20), the players you have to see in person to appreciate (56:55), if Philly will draft a running back (01:02:27), Jason's actual scouting report (01:09:10), and how Daniel jumped from NFL scouting to media (01:10:57).

As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday &amp;amp; check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

      <itunes:episode>28</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>On the twenty-eighth episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Fireball, this is the definitive recap of Super Bowl 57.

Jason and Travis weigh in on what they thought of the field conditions during pre-game warm-ups (23:53), what they felt during the anthem (34:00), what it was like seeing Donna Kelce on the jumbotron (38:45), and if there was any shit-talking during the coin toss (41:01).

We then break down the game itself starting with a very Kelce-centric first quarter (42:05), how the Eagles responded to a huge second-quarter turnover (45:05), and what adjustments the Chiefs made in the locker room at halftime (48:34).

We also touch on the Chiefs starting the second half strong (53:23), how the Chiefs tied it all up with a play called "corn dog(55:51)," the third down play that Jason is still thinking about (57:10), Jalen Hurts 4th quarter drive to tie the game (01:00:20), and Travis walks us through the Chiefs go-ahead field goal to clinch Super Bowl 57 (01:01:20).

Jason and Travis then give their final thoughts on the game's "controversial" ending (01:05:26), the enormous emotions they were feeling seeing their family on the field (01:21:02), and Jason reveals the one thing that could have made this the greatest Super Bowl of all time (01:28:00).

After the game discussion, we finally have Travis make his pick for the long-awaited name of the New Heights fan base (01:29:50), we answer a not-dumb question about the inevitable casting of the "Kelce Bowl" movie (01:33:53), and we talk a little bit about what we have planned next for the show (01:48:11).

As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday &amp;amp; check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

Travis recaps how the Chiefs overcame an injury to Pat Mahomes to beat the Jags (40:00), why the team had all the confidence that Henne-thing was possible (45:00), and how he managed to have another record-setting day (48:12).

Jason gives us all the details on the Eagles huge win against the Giants (56:00), why nothing beats the playoff atmosphere at the Linc (59:30), and why Boston Scott might continue being "the giant killer" (01:04:18).

We also recap the Bengals snowy win over the Bills (01:10:54), why Jason can relate to Stefon Diggs frustrations (01:14:50), and try to figure out what the hell was going on during the electric season-ending play the Cowboys rolled out against the 49ers (01:20:30).

Finally, we shout out the fan that made Jason's baby signing dream come true (01:31:40) and look ahead to our games coming up on Championship Sunday (01:36:00).

As always, watch and listen to new episodes of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce every Wednesday during the NFL season &amp;amp; check us out on Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok for all the best moments from the show.

There's also some non-playoff NFL news to talk about with Aaron Donald possibly announcing his retirement via his Twitter bio (01:00:30), Kliff Kingsbury booking a one-way ticket to Thailand which got us talking about an incredible monkey encounter Jason had overseas (01:02:50), and someone at the Athletic finally doing the official math on the QB sneak (01:08:10).

Finally, we wrap with a look ahead to the Divisional round of the playoffs with the Eagles playing the Giants for the third time this season (01:12:40), the Chiefs at home against the Jags (01:17:41), but more importantly, we go way off script with a discussion about Waffle House and where it ranks in the world of breakfast chain restaurants (01:20:45).

      <itunes:summary>On the twenty-second episode of New Heights, we've been asking you guys who you wanted on the show and there was one name that came up every time, or at least 92% of the time. So we finally got the 5x pro bowler, 4x first-team NFL all-pro, 4x Super Bowl Champion, and one of the best to ever do it, Rob Gronkowski.

In this episode, Jason and Travis get the details about why Gronk is kicking a field goal at the Super Bowl (03:00), the return of "Gronk Beach" (06:20), and acting alongside GILFs (09:15).

We find out whether we'll see Gronk return in the playoffs (11:20), why he's got an eye on the Buffalo Bills (17:00), why the Patriots were already yelling at him on Draft Day (20:30), and how he ended up at the University of Arizona (29:50).

Travis and Jason get the behind-the-scenes stories from Gronk's rookie year with the Patriots (32:50), his first time meeting Tom Brady (35:50), the insanity that was trying to block Brandon Spikes (41:00), why Belichick is the greatest coach of all time (42:35), where he thinks Brady goes next (47:3-), and his welcome to the NFL moment with Vince Wilfork (48:50).

Gronk opens up about what it's been like to constantly get compared to Travis and what TE records he hopes never get broken (51:10), why Jeremy Shockey was his TE role model (58:15), how the position has changed (01:00:50), and who's the next TE to watch out for (01:04:10).

Finally, we get Gronk's POV on some of our signature segments with his Mt. Rushmore of NFL brothers (01:10:30), our not-dumb question about animals playing football (01:14:0), Gronk's advice to his younger self (01:19:00), and his stamp of the week that you absolutely don't see coming (01:21:20).

      <itunes:summary>On the nineteenth episode of New Heights, Jason and Travis react to being named Sports Illustrated's "Podcast of the Year" (2:00), we have an update on the fanbase name suggestions (5:30), and we answer the not-dumb questions, "What do head coaches do during games if they don't call plays?" (9:00)

We then jump into Travis finally getting on the scoreboard against Geno Smith (17:50), why nipples are nature's thermostats (20:30), and find out who had the idea to give Andy Reid a cheeseburger for Christmas (24:10).

Jason recaps the Eagles game in Dallas (28:15), what Gardner Minshew is really like to play with (30:35), and why December football already feels like the playoffs (35:30).

Later, we take a look back at some of Jason and Travis' favorite Pro Bowl Memories of the Bennett Brothers (44:00), we try to figure out what's going on in Broncos' Country (49:25), if the Mac Jones tackle was actually dirty (52:30), how they would handle the bizarre playoff scenario in the ACF South (59:10), and react to the new JJ Watt is retiring (01:01:05).

We close out with a look ahead to week 17 as the Eagles try and wrap up the #1 seed against the Saints (01:09:45) and the Chiefs try to stay in the hunt for first place against the Broncos (01:12:43).

Also, Travis explains how we might not be giving enough credit to the 1-win Texans after they took the Chiefs to OT (25:52), what ridiculous record Patrick Mahomes might break next (31:50), and how Shannon Sharpe has been an incredible mentor throughout his career (33:10).

Jason lets us know that the Chicago cold hits just a little bit differently (45:18), how the Eagles D-Line keeps putting up historic numbers (52:25), and what he said to Justin Fields after the game (54:20).

We wrap with a look ahead to Week 16 with Jason's thoughts on the Micah Parson comments (01:16:20) before the Cowboys game and how Travis is prepping for his shot to maybe finally get a win over Geno Smith (01:21:43).

      <itunes:summary>On the sixteenth episode of New Heights, Jason describes the "whoopin'" that AJ Brown and the Eagles put on the Titans (12:50) and debate if Jason finally played dress-up before the game with his 50 First Dates tribute (26:30).

And we gotta talk about it, Travis breaks down the Chiefs coming up short against the Bengals (31:55), how he felt after the critical 4th quarter fumble (33:20), and after seeing "Air Mahomes" we debate if anyone in the NFL could play in the NBA (37:35).

We also react to the breaking (at the time) news of Baker Mayfield signing with the Rams (49:55), examine Andrew Luck breaking his silence on retirement (53:00), take a look at some exciting sideline coaching moments from week 13 (01:01:50), and figure out what kind of coaches Peyton and Eli will be during the Pro Bowl (01:08:50).

The guys also wonder why Jason didn't get the call for the Cincinnati Bearcats job (01:11:20) how Deion might fare at Colorado (01:15:08), and if we need more teams in the college football playoff (01:17:21).

We wrap with a look ahead to both of our divisional showdowns (01:22:20) with the Eagles taking on the Giants and the Chiefs heading to Denver to see if Broncos country is still riding with Russell Wilson.

      <itunes:summary>On the fifteenth episode of New Heights, we finally got him despite the fastest invitation of all time (5:15). We finally got to sit down and have an incredible conversation with 4-time pro bowler, NFL MVP, and Super Bowl Champion Quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs, Patrick Mahomes.

In this episode, Jason and Travis get Pat to explain why the Chiefs might not be running the QB sneak any time soon (6:50) We also dive into our most heated New Heights debate, who has the best fast food burger (11:40), the insane story about why Pat crushed his draft interview with Andy Reid (15:20), how his relationship with Alex Smith made him a better pro (20:35), and the legendary first meeting that led to his bromance with Travis (29:00).

The guys also get the never before heard backstory of how Pat basically drafted himself in 2017 (47:10), how he's adjusted to running an offense with a Tight End (42:55), why his greatest rival might be the teleprompter (57:02), and his welcome to the NFL moment playing against Tom Brady (58:20).

We also have some incredible stories behind his first start as a Chief (59:50 ) how he really feels about all those wild comebacks (01:07:10), his thoughts on all the MVP chatter (01:21:31), and all the comparisons to Michael Jordan and Steph Curry (01:27:40).

Patrick also shares the superstitions he's kept with him since his rookie year (01:31:08), what rivalries he's got with other QBs (01:36:20), who is on his QB, Mt. Rushmore (01:38:30), and why Travis might not be the greatest beer pong partner (01:40:01).

      <itunes:summary>On the fourteenth episode of New Heights, we try and tease the Patrick Mahomes episode we're dropping later this week but maybe give too much away (02:05), Jason lets us know the response he's gotten to the Eagles Christmas album (03:05), and we take a look at some of the incredible fan art we saw at Arrowhead this weekend (07:45).

We break down our games from Week 12 starting with the Chiefs big win over the defending Super Bowl champion Rams(14:30). We find out how Travis almost called an insane audible during his biggest play of the game (16:00) and how he really feels about drawing the defense's best cover guy every week (18:13).

And we look at how "fly, Eagles fly" turned into "run, Eagles run" on Sunday Night Football (35:48). Jason reveals what he did with the game ball (41:10), and we try to figure out if any records are left for Jalen Hurts to break (44:40).

Also around the league, we look at the debut of what might be the must-have accessory this Holiday season with Brian Robinson's big hat (51:20) and debate if Darrell Taylor is the best teammate you could want on the sideline (53:15).

We close with a look ahead to week 13 with the Eagles huge matchup against Derrick Henry and the Titans (01:01:50) and the game Travis might have had circled all season, the Chiefs AFC title game rematch against Joe Burrow and the Bengals (01:04:05).

So make sure you're subscribed and have the notifications turned on so you can know exactly when that episode drops.

Also on the show, We break down Travis' Sunday Night Football hat trick in the Chiefs' win over the Chargers and debate how real his MVP candidacy might be this year. We also dive deep into the evolution of the tight-end position and take a look at a Primetime shoutout he got after the game.

We then jump into the Eagles' electric fourth-quarter comeback against the Colts, what Jason thinks about his new teammates, Ndamukong Suh and Linval Joseph, first starts, and we find out if he stopped Jalen Hurts from being taunted into a flag by the Colts Mascot.

And finally, we talk turkey. Jason and Travis reveal the people they've been the most thankful for in their playing careers, and we have the official New Heights Turkey Bowl Backyard football draft. Do the guys think Shaq would dominate as a backyard football tight end? I mean of course, but you're going to want to hear who they think should be throwing him the ball.

Close out with a look ahead to the Eagles/Packers Sunday Night Football showdown and the debut of the Eagles' new all-black uniforms, and Travis looks to get on the "non-buns side" in the rematch of maybe the greatest regular season game of all time when the Rams play the Chiefs.

      <itunes:summary>On the twelfth episode of New Heights, we react to the incredible response to the Jalen Hurts episode (01:00) and see if Travis will finally be able to ask Patrick Mahomes to stop by (01:25) We also look at all of the great guest suggestions you sent in (05:00), more fanbase name ideas (6:30), and answer another of your great questions which leads to an incredible story of Travis' time as a telemarketer (9:40).

We break down the games from week 10 starting with the Chiefs' offense continuing to spread the ball around to all of their playmakers (15:32) and what that means for Travis' role in the offense (17:50) and try to figure out how the hell the Giants let Kadarius Toney go (22:50).

And it finally happened, the Eagles suffered their first loss on Monday Night Football and Jason gives us his biggest takeaway from the game (30:05), why he's sick of everyone rushing to blame it on the refs (31:10), and why going undefeated gets too hyped up by every team every year (37:10).

Finally, we check out how the NFLPA is using New Heights to promote #Saferfields (42:50), find out which field left the biggest mark on Travis (46:15), and look at the incredible turnout from the German fans (50:08). We also answer some of the week's biggest questions; did the Bills and Vikings ruing the QB sneak (55:00), is there crying in football (01:01:50) and did Jeff Saturday earn himself a New Heights Stamp of the week (01:04:12)?

We wrap with a look ahead to the Eagles heading to Indy to see Coach Jeff Saturday in person (01:07:25) and see if Travis will try and repeat his attempt to jump over Derwin James when the Chiefs take on the Chargers in LA (01:13:00).
